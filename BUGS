When the 1.0/coerFreq/busWidth < VSWDelay the Arb is not able to track 
correctly the OBUF credits and the OBUF explodes...
A fix would be to add counter in the OBUF of used credits and then 
let the VLA to incr when a credit is post to pass teh switch and decrement 
by the OBUF on send.

But I think that since OBUF needs reveisit - since it us not a fixed size buf 
and the arb crietria is actually never filling more than N? MTUs it is better
to stop counting credits and do the full change
